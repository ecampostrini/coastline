+ 	PNG_ZLIB_VERNUM should be changed to 0x1280 in pnglibconf.h so it matches the
	current version of zlib.
+	The modifications done to math.h through the patch may have to be applied to mainline
	in the future.
+   If I don't set --disable-shared the linker complains saying that cannot find crtbeginS.o, 
	but the file is actually present in the correspondent directory
